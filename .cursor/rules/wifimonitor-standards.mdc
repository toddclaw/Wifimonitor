# Wifimonitor — Coding Standards

## Methodology

- Software Craftsmanship: TDD, SOLID, clean code
- Test-first: no production code without a failing test first
- Coverage: 90%+ overall; 100% on pure functions (parsers, helpers)

## Code Quality

- Type hints required on all public interfaces
- Docstrings: Google style on public classes and functions
- Python 3.9+ (enforced at runtime)

## Version Control

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`
- Feature branches off `main`; PRs required — no direct pushes to main

## Agent Roles

| Agent | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| Architect | Research approaches, define APIs/modules |
| TDD | Writing production or test code |
| DevSecOps | Security review, dependency audit, CI/CD |
| Red Team | Adversarial review before merge |
| Scrum Master | Backlog grooming, prioritization, retros |
| Manager | Orchestrate all agents end-to-end |
